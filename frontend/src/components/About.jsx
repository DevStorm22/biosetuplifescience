        Dummy text is a type of placeholder text used in design and layout
        processes to simulate real content without conveying meaningful
        information. It allows designers, developers, and content creators to
        focus on visual aspects such as typography, spacing, and overall
        aesthetics before final copy is available. The most well-known example
        of dummy text is Lorem ipsum, which has been used since the 1500s in the
        printing and publishing industries. Lorem ipsum is derived from a
        corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC
        text by the Roman philosopher Cicero, with words altered to create
        nonsensical Latin. This text became widely popular in the 1960s through
        Letraset transfer sheets and was later adopted by desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker in the 1980s. Its primary purpose is to
        demonstrate layout and font design without the distraction of readable
        content, ensuring that the visual presentation is evaluated
        independently of the actual message.
